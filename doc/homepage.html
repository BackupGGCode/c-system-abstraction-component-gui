<hr>
<p>SACK has been under development for some 5 or 6 years.  It's an interesting beast, but not unlike many other
products of similar form and function.  Recent developments have extended reach to C++, wherein namespacing was
introduced to make things somewhat more easy to reference within a sufficiently advanced environment.

<p>Recently I've been doing some silly things, such as there is now an image rendering
module which renders to a webpage.  Any sack application therefore can be embedded as an 
image object within a webpage.  The area is bounded by an anchor to provide button event information
to the application.

<p>Going to have to spend some more time on this webpage... since I've probably only ever spent about 20 hours 
tops on all this documentation...

<p>Should probably get more to the useful points instead of just being a broad discussion of what this is,
and what its parts do.  <a href="howto.html">Go here for the quick start</a>

<a href="render.html">Image Display/Rendering</a><menu>A set of routines to handle

<a href="msgsvr.html">Message Services Client/Server Library</a><menu>
Applications may register services by name, and provice a message handling method, which
services may then connect to.  Message interaction is typically transaction based form client to server
( client sends a request and the server responds ), and event based from the server to the client ( the server
sends events to the client, which do not require, and may not have, a responce from the client ).</menu>

<p>more to come...
