<H2>Summary</H2><DIR>

<P>All jobs were full cycle product development, including writing specifications, laying out the programs, coding, and verification testing of the programs.</P>
<P>Most application development using C/C++ and Intel x86 assembly.&nbsp; I have skill in Java, Fortran, Basic, and Pascal.&nbsp; I have a little knowledge of LISP and Cobol, Fourth, Prolog.&nbsp; I have been a network administrator, responsible for setting up and maintaining a network to provide video broadcasting, shared printers and shared file systems.&nbsp; I have installed, configured, and maintained Windows 95/98, NT, and RedHat Linux.&nbsp; I have done PC repair work and maintenance.&nbsp; I have done hardware diagnostics and used logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, and learned about programmable chips.&nbsp; I've developed applications that use the Windows Sound Multi-media subsystem.&nbsp; I am very familiar with Personal computers at all levels, which my first job encouraged, as one cannot write effective, and efficient applications without knowing the platform they are for (included use of a logic analyzer on CPU signals for code and memory trending).&nbsp; Most of my previous experience is in real-time (in-time or near-time) data distribution and event based process control.&nbsp; Various other projects I have worked on in personal time explore most every aspect of computers and programming (User I/O, Video/Graphics, Sound, Disk management, File design and layout for efficient access...).&nbsp; I'm very adept at picking up new applications quickly. </P>
<P>Personal vocations have brought me to optimize 3d code for a long time.&nbsp; I have folders and archives of various projects I have worked on.&nbsp; My most recent project was to use arbitrary plane defined by an origin and a normal, and have the software automatically compute intersecting lines and find bound surfaces for step-wise refining of complex shapes. Also developed an interactive breadboard for designing neural circuits.&nbsp; (First pass gives say 6 bounding planes, and longer interaction allows more time for further cutting planes to provide fine definition)... Note specifically under education the mathematics background.</P>
<P>During my affiliation with an Internet video stream provider, I worked to develop applications, which were network and more specifically Internet based. </P></DIR>
