<p>This set of libraries supports several compilers, and makes building
release (optimized) and debug (more checks, logging) versions simple. 
The make system is modeled somewhat on Visual Studio's idea of how to
build projects.  It has been extended to also build static and dynamic
libraries/programs.  Dynamic libraries are .DLL's and .so's on
respective systems.  Static libraries are .lib, .a products on
respective systems.

<p>Several environment variables control this make system.
<MENU>
<LI>FINALDEST
<menu>Specifies the directory for the final destination.  Libraries
specified with MORELIBS will be referenced from the appropriate library
directory.
</menu>
<li>COMPILER
<menu>Specifies the compiler to use when making these products and
anything using this make system.
<li>lnx - GCC (3.2 or higher preferred) - target system is
Linux.
<li>wc - Open Watcom compiler (www.openwatcom.org).  This is the
preferred compiler to use when building windows applications.  This
compiler supports OS2, Win16, Win32, QNX(?), Linux(?)
<li>bcc - Borland C 3.1 - expiramental, probably
incomplete. Target is 16 bit windows.
<li>b32 - Borland free command line tools (5.5) - expiramental.
<li>cyg - Cygwin environment, (sources.redhat.com/cygwin). 
Unmaintained.  Should nearly mimic linux environemt.  -mno-cygwin
option MUST be used.
<li>lcc - LCC Win32 (from q software solutions) is used to compile
windows projects.  This is a C only compiler, and some current projects
fail because there's aspects of C++ in them.  Further, there were some
issues when linking with 15 DLLs that cause fopen(), fprintf() to fail.
Additionally if a routine is defined __declspec(dllexport) the routine
MUST exist, which causes the display library to fail building... Since
it is merely a layer for image/video and performs most all the same
functions, but relies on image/video for the remainder.  (Obsolete)
<li>vc - MSVC - expiramental and only roughly tested.  Debug
information options are not complete.
<li>dm - Digital Mars compiler - to be implemented?
</menu>
<li>DEFAULT_DEST
<menu>
<p>This specifies a default value for the make argument DEST=.  If a
command line destination is specified it overrides the DEFAULT_DEST
defined in the environment.
<p>The value of the destionation determines the directory the
intermediate products are built into... $(PROJECT)/$(DEST). where
PROJECT specifes some library/program directory.

<li>debug - defines flag _DEBUG for compiled code.  Generates debug
information appropriate for the compiler selected.  Dynamic/shared
libraries are built, and programs are linked to use these libraries.
Project intermediates are built into $(project)/debug.  Final products
are built into $(FINALDEST)/bin/debug, and $(FINALDEST)/lib/debug.
MODE=debug.
<li>static_debug - Same as debug mode, except, libraries are built
statically.  .lib, .a final library targets are built into
$(FINALDEST)/lib/debug, programs only are built into
$(FINALDEST)/bin/debug.  Products will also have an 's' appended to the
end of their name (and before their extension).  For example
syslog.lib becomes syslogs.lib; bin/libsyslog.so becomes
lib/libsyslogs.a.  This is true for any static_ destionation.
intermediate files are built into $(project)/static_debug. MODE=debug.
<li>release - does not define _DEBUG.  Generates optimized code, and no
debug information.  Intermediate files are built into
$(project)/release.  MODE=release.
<li>static_release - Library names are mangled to have an 's' appended.
intermediate files are built into $(project)/static_release.
MODE=release.
</menu>

</menu>


<p>Final products are built into $(FINALDEST)/bin/$(MODE), and
$(FINALDEST)/lib/$(MODE).  Static libraries, and the import link
libraries are built into lib.  Dynamic libraries and programs are built
into bin.  $(FINALDEST) if not specified is $(SACK_BASE) when building
projects within the SACK subsystem.  This is overridden appropriately
for ELTANIN_BASE, ALTANIK_BASE as appropriate for project sub-trees.


<p><a href="syslog.html">Project: System Logging</a><br>
Location: src/sysloglib <br>
Linux products: lib/libsyslogs.a, bin/libsyslog.so  <br>
Windows products: lib/syslogs.lib, lib/syslog.lib & bin/syslog.dll<br>
<menu>Used for a common point to control program logging.  On the fly, the 
target for any logging messages may be changed.  Options also include time
stamp on all messages either in delta or absolute format.  Resolution of times
can be from CPU ticks to seconds.  Debug mode code generates messages which include
__FILE__(__LINE__): prefixes by default.

---- any notes on the make system are OBSOLETE --
---- Please do bear with me while we reconstruct ----


This project directory is meant to be at the root of the development
drive.  This can be accomplished with the 'subst' command...

	 mkdir c:\development
	 : assuming you have no real M drive you could do....
	 subst M: c:\development
	 : thereby making M:\ be the root of the development

unzip (with directories) common.zip into c:\development OR M:\

MAKING Projects
--------------------------
	Supported systems now include Linux, LCC, CYGWIN, FreeBSD

	Basic library building is merely running ../makeset from the project
	directory.  Now, depending on your system, and compiler, there are several
	makesets available.  

		Makefile - 

	4(four) versions the each library are built.  Release, Debug, both of
	these are shared library or dll versions.  Static release, debug, 
	both of these are used for static linking.  Debug information included
	in debug versions is specific for each development system.  

	The previous makeset files are merely four(4) make -f ..\makefile.xxxxxx
	script lines.  *.fbsd is for freebsd, *.lnx if for LInux, *.lcc is for
	LCC compiler (using GNU make), and .cyg is for cygwin compiler.  Each
	of these first includes makefile.cm1 and makefile.cm2 in each project
	directory.  makefile.cm1 details names to build, and objects required
	to build.  makefile.cm2 are the make rules required to build each object.

	On a linux/freebsd system libraries are built with lib<name> format.
	With LCC, libraries are built without the lib prefix.  Each static version
	is built with an 's' appended to the name... ie network librarie is built
	libnetwork.so, libnetworks.a on linux/freebsd/cygwin; network.dll
	, networks.lib is built using LCC.

	Some projects - Image require nasm, and LCC to build on windows.  
	library has not been tested on Linux since Vidlib does not compile - there
	is no way to display images on a linux system.  

Other Documents
--------------------------
	Memory.Doc describes the memory library

	Network.doc describes the netlib, networking

	Image.doc describes the image library
		( somewhat requires jpeg-6b, png, zlib )

	Vectlib.doc describes the vector transformation library

	jpeg, png, and zlib contain their own documentaion and may be
	   downloaded in somewhat original form... mind you the makefile.cm1, 
	   makefile.cm2 have been written to facilitate compatible versions for
	   linking with the image library.

	Vidlib.doc - describes the video output functions written for Windows.
	   Uses the image library, and displays images built with it into
	   a window.  Includes the beginnings of a GDI which is platform
	   non-specific.
