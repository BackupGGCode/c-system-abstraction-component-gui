<h2>C++ Routines</h2>
There are some problems with using this library with C++.  Release is often
a method for objects which have reference counts.  Since Release is a defined
macro, this can cause undefined symbols, error in parsing... A smart C pre-processor
could discount any substitutions for which the parameter count does not match,
and such conflicts MAY be overcome.
<menu>
<h3>new</h3>
<menu>
An override for the new operator causes new to allocate memory from Allocate().
</menU>
<h3>newEx( CTEXTSTR pFile, _32 nLine )</h3>
<menu>
Used exactly as a 'new' operator would be used.
An override for the new operator causes new to allocate memory from Allocate().
And allow the credit for the allocate to be redirected.  Otherwise the 
current file/line is credited with the allocation.
</menU>
<h3>delete</h3>
<menu>
An override for the data operator causes memory to be released with Release().
There is an oversite in the C++ specification that does not allow extra
paramters to be passed to delete.  Therefore the credit of who released the 
memory may not be overridden, and one must guess the actual culprit of a 
faulty release.

   void *Allocate( int nSize )
      Allocates a block of memory similar to malloc().  This block is not
      initialized to any value, and is considered to be filled with noise.
	also:
	   POINTER HeapAllocate( PMEM *ppHeap, size );
	      Heap functions will allocate from a specified memory heap.
	      Such a heap's creation and use are discussed near the end.


   POINTER Release( POINTER pMemory )
      When you are done with a block, you call Release to release it.  If
      the pointer result is not NULL, then someone still owns the memory block.


   POINTER Hold( POINTER pMemory )
      This increments the number of times a block is held.  This prevents
      a Release from actually returning the block to the free memory pool
      until it has been Released as many times as it was held.

   POINTER Reallocate( POINTER, _32 newsize )
   	This will allocate a new block of the size specified (may be larger
   	or smaller than the existing memory block's size.  The existing
   	memory's content is copied to the new block.  If the new size
   	is larger, the excess space will be 0 filled.  The pointer passed in
   	may be NULL, in which case a new block of memory is created, and
   	is initialized to zero.
	also:
		POINTER HeapReallocate( PMEM pHeap, POINTER, _32 size );
			A block MAY be reallocated into a specified heap, even if the 
			original block was not from that heap.

   int Defragment( void **ppMemory ) 
      This routine checks to see if the block of memory immediately pre-
      ceeding the block poited by the passed variable is free.  If the
      block IS free, the memory block is moved down to the beginning
      of the free memory block, the pointer is updated, and the function
      returns the value TRUE.  ANY other variables which pointed to this
      block MUST be updated by the USER to reference the new value.
      If the memory block was not moved, the function returns FALSE, and
      no additional changes are needed.      

	_32 SizeOfMemBlock( POINTER pData )
		The size of a memory block allocated may be discovered using this
		on a pointer returned from either Allocate or Reallocate.


   DEBUG MODE CODE CHANGE:
      These routines actually translates to 
         AlocateEx( int size DBG_PASS )
         ReleaseEx( void *p DBG_PASS )
         HoldEx( void *p DBG_PASS ) 

      and assumes to pass DBG_SRC or DBG_RELAY
      to the function.  This expansion is only valid when _DEBUG is defined
      and or the debug version of the library is used.
      

Functions added because of prior badly coded libraries
-----------------------------------------
   void MemSet( void *p, int value, int size ) (int assumed 32 bit)
      sets the integer value into memory (not a byte value ) but 
      every 4 bytes in the memory will match the value in a...
      any odd bytes at the end will not have the assumed partial, but
      may have the low short and low byte duplicated.....

   void MemCpy( void *pTo, void *pFrom, int size )
      Copies memory from the location pointed to by pFrom into the 
      location pointed at by pTo for "size" bytes... This function
      copies from the lowest address to the highest address, and does
      not consider that the memory may overlap.

Functions to query statistics and information about memory
-----------------------------------------
   void SetAllocateDebug( BOOL bDisable )
      This function only changes the code if the library was compiled
      with _DEBUG... If the library is set to debug, then this will/can
      disable : 
         -(IF compiled with STRONG_DIAGNOSTIC or MEMTRACKING )
            The creation of an additional file for additional dianostic
            and tracking information.

         -(IF compiled with STRONG_DIAGNOSTIC )
            The calling of DiagMem() after a memory allocation.
            calling WriteDebugLog() during DebugDumpMemEx( );

         -Calling GetMemStats() before and after each Allocate(), and 
            Release()

         -Adding an addition 4 bytes at the end of each memory block to store
            0x12345678; this is purposed to watch for application memory 
            overflow.

         -Logging of pFile, and nLine in the blocks allocated, 
            released, or held.

         -When a block is released, it is cleared to the value 0xFACEBEAD

   void SetAllocateLogging( BOOL bTrueFalse )
      Enables(TRUE) or Disables(FALSE) a continual logging of allocates,
      releases, and holds performed.  On Windows - this information is
      logged using OutputDebugString, on unix it is logged to stderr.


   void GetMemStats( DWORD *pFree, DWORD *pUsed
                   , DWORD *pChunks, DWORD *pFreeChunks )      
      This routine is designed to give the internal accounting of how
      memory is currently allocated.  *pFree returns the total size 
      of free memory which exists; it is the sum of all free blocks.
      *pUsed returns the total size of memory allocated; it is the sum
      of the size of all allocated blocks.  *pChunks is an absolute 
      count of how many blocks of memory both free and allocated exist.
      *pFreeChunks is the count of how many blocks of free memory exist.
      The number of actual allocated chunks may be computed by subtracting
      *pFreeChunks from *pChunks.  If any of these are NULL the value 
      is NOT returned, otherwise they are assumed to be valid pointers 
      to an unsigned 32 bit variable.

      This routine is also a diagnostic, since all memory blocks
      MUST be valid, and each free block must be chained together, 
      this routine can fail BADLY if the application messed up the
      block linkages... MOST places where it would fall off memory
      have been accounted for and are avoided.


   void DebugDumpMemEx( BOOL bVerbose )
      On Windows - this function outputs using OutputDebugString(), on 
      a unix type system this is logged to stderr.  It logs each memory 
      block allocated, or released, and it's size.  If the debug 
      version of the file is being used and SetAllocateDebug
      has not disabled the debug info, the File and Line of the 
      allocator, or releaser of the block is logged.

Additional Memory Related Functions
-----------------------------------------
   These functions are considered low level system services, but
   are used first in this library to coordinate ownership of the meory.

   unsigned long LockedExchange( unsigned long *p, unsigned long val )
      This function performs in a single CPU clock (with memory locked)
      an exchange of the value passed with the value pointed to by p.
      The previous value is returned in p.  This is useful for simple
      mutual exclusion locking.

   --------- Critical Code Section Control -------------
      
   void InitializeCriticalSec( PCRITICALSECTION pcs )
      Clears the memory associated with a CRITICALSECTION function.
      Although these functions all accept a PCRITICALSECTION pointer
      to critical section, the critical section must be allocated
      by the caller, and the address passed to these funtions.

   void DeleteCriticalSec( PCRITICALSECTION pcs )
   	Results in nothing - no system objects are used for these
   	critical sections.

   int EnterCriticalSec( PCRITICALSECTION pcs )
      returns TRUE (non zero) when the code may proceed through the 
      section.  This prevents multple threads in the same process 
      ( or multiple processes using the same shared memory region )
      from executing.

   int LeaveCriticalSec( PCRITICALSECTION pcs )
      When a thread completes a section of code which other threads 
      may/must be locked out of, this routine is called to allow 
      other waiting threads to continue.

Opening Shared Memory Spaces
----------------------------------------
PMEM OpenSpace( CTEXTSTR pWhat, CTEXTSTR pWhere, P_32 dwSize )
   pWhat - a string name of the mapping object for a common name
           to open between processes...(named region)
   pWhere - is the name of a file to use as the memory....
   *dwSize - is initially set the the size of the memory to open, 
             and results with the size of the memory actually opened.

   if pWhat and pWhere are BOTH NULL - the memory space is opened
   non shared- and is backed in the system page file.
   if pWhere is NULL, the pWhat MAY point to a valid memory retion 
   already open, if such a region is not open, this function will fail.
   if pWhat is NULL, and pWhere is a name - the file will be opened 
   and mapped into memory, but will not be sharable between processes.

   Results: 
   	NULL - space is not opened, however...
   		if the dwSize pointer is NULL, you'll get back NULL.
   		if the dwSize passed is 0, then on resulting NULL
   		    if dwSize is still 0, then the pWhere filename could not be opened.
   		    if dwSize is still 0, then the name pWhat for the named region may not have opened.
   		    if dwSize is 1, then the file did not exist, but could exist.
   		    if dwSize is larger, then the file existed, and the result is the size.
      not NULL - space has been opened
         dwSize should reflect the size of the object mapped.  UNTESTED case
         if the region opened existed as a named region, not sure if the size
         is updated.
         

PMEM OpenSpaceEx( CTEXTSTR pWhat, CTEXTSTR pWhere, _32 address, P_32 dwSize )

_32 GetSpaceSize( POINTER pMem )
	This will result in the size of the memory area allocated (opened).

void  CloseSpace( PBYTE pMem )
   Unmap a file which has been opened... MAY work and probably will

DWORD GetSpaceSize( PBYTE pMem )
   Forgot the size of the thing you allocated? ask for it again.

void InitHeap( PMEM pMem, DWORD dwSize )
	This sets up a memory block to be initialized and able to be passed
	as a ppHeap.  The dwSize should be the size resulting from an OpenSpace.

	

Changing the Compilation by modifying internal #DEFINES
-----------------------------------------
   #ifdef _DEBUG // ONLY if this flag is defined do the following 
                 // have any effect...
   // may define one or the other of these but NOT both
   #define STRONG_DIAGNOSTIC 
      // logs allocs, holds, and release ordered queue...
   #define MEM_TRACKING  
      // logs allocs, holds, and releases with an accounthing list


   if YOU are worried about using these - YOU can search through the 
   one single file sharemem.c and figure out where they are used...
   the code was rough and is badly documented by only a couple dozen
   lines so it shouldn't be too bad to figure out.

   Both of these were more for figuring out errors the library was
   making, not errors that the application may cause to the memory
   system.


Alternative Heap Usage
-----------------------------------------------------
	struct {
		_32 dwMemorySize;
		POINTER pMemory;
	} g;

	....

	g.dwMemorySize = 64000;
	g.pMemory = OpenSpaceEx( "Display Object Heap"
	                     , "display.memory"
	                     , 0xC000000 // some arbitrary constant address
	                     , &g.dwMemorySize );
	// hmm - may need some sort of information/signature 
	// as to whether the memory already existed...
	// OpenSpace will not modify any content of the memory returned.
	// As a static ram, InitHeap should be called once and ONLY once
	// if the region did not previously exist.
	if( g.pMemory )
		InitHeap( g.pMemory, g.dwMemorySize );

	...

	POINTER p = HeapAllocate( &g.pMemory, 768 );
	p = Release( p ); // normal release can be used on any memory.

	....

	CloseSpace( g.pMemory );


	This idea allows portions of memory to be mapped to static file, and 
	use the operating system to make sure that the file content is the same
	as the memory.  (Should check into methods to force synchronization at
	critical steps)


POINTER HeapMove( PMEM pNewHeap, POINTER )
	This reallocates the exact size of the pointer passed.  This is most 
	useful to move a memory object to a specialized heap.  Could be done
	with Reallocate, but then SizeOfMemBlock() would need to be used.


POINTER GetFirstUsedBlock( PMEM pHeap )
	This results in the very first block of memory (if it's free or used is
	not of consequence.)


	As it so happens, The first allocation in a memory region will be first
	physically, logically, etc.  So, when using custom heaps, if you 'wisely' 
	choose a good thing (the global data structure) to allocate first, then
	you can receive that on responce.

	When using OpenSpace, there are several results... 
		Please see OpenSpace(above).
