<h2>About this Library</h2>
<menu>
    This library is designed to implement a software-based, simple (FIFO only) 
    caching system.  It is useful for storing data in memory before being 
    written to a disk or database when recent values are accessed often.  This 
    library works very well with the SACK container library by using POINTERs to
    handle arbitrary data.  It also works very well with the SACK network 
    library because data can be written to the cache in the "read complete" 
    callback functions and then the cache can be emptied during idle times in 
    the main program thread.

<h3>Cache Data Methods</h3>
These are methods that act on CacheData.  CacheData is a structure that encompasses
user-data.  It is not necessary for the end-user ever access members of the CacheData
struct.  It is just used to hold meta-data needed by the cache library.
<menu>
<h3>CacheData * createCacheData( POINTER data , unsigned int size)<br>
</h3>
<menu>
Creates a CacheData object which can contain anything, but should probably be a 
    user-defined struct so that data indexing/keying can be done.  data should 
    be a pointer to the data and size should be the size of that data.
</menu>
</menu>
<h3>Cache Methods</h3>
These are methods that act on the cache system itself.
<menu>
<h3>Cache * createCache()</h3>
<menu>
This initializes a Cache object to which CacheData can be added
</menu>
<h3>void deleteCache( Cache *cache )</h3>
<menu>
This function frees all memory that is being used by a Cache object.  All data 
    in the cache is lost.
</menu>
<h3>int setCacheStoreFunction( Cache *cache , int *storeItemFn )</h3>
<menu>
    This function sets the callback function that stores a CacheData object to 
    whereever the user wants.  The callback function should have the signature: 
    int fnName( POINTER , unsigned int ).  The POINTER will point to the 
    user-data stored inside the CacheData (CacheData itself is a library-level 
    struct and the end user should never need to access its members).  The unsigned
    int is the size of that data.  The end-user can use this function to write data
    to a more permanant location like a file or a database.
</menu>
<h3>int setCacheSearchFunction( Cache *cache , POINTER searchItemFn )</h3>
<menu>
    This function sets the callback function that searches the data stored in a
    CacheData object for a specific key.  The function needs the signature:  
    POINTER fnName( POINTER , unsigned int , int ).  The POINTER will point to the
    user-data stored inside the CacheData object.  The unsigned int will be the 
    size of that data, and the int will be the key that was requested.  This works
    best when the data is a user-defined struct that has a key (perhaps used to 
    store an enum) and a value field.  This function should always return NULL if
    the key was not found in the data.
</menu>
<h3>int addItemToCache( Cache *cache , CacheData *data )</h3>
<menu>
    This function adds a CacheData item to the cache.  This function is usually 
    best called by using a call to the createCacheData() function as the second
    parameter.  Example:
    <pre>
        struct cData
        {
            int key; /* This would be used for data identification in the search callback function */
            char data[25];
        }

        void test( Cache *cache )
        {
            struct cData *data;

            data->key = 1;
            data->data = "Hello world";

            addItemToCache( cache , createCacheData( data , sizeof( struct cData ) ) );
        }
    </pre>
</menu>
<h3>int storeItemInCache( Cache *cache )</h3>
<menu>
    This function writes the OLDEST item in the cache to disk, using the store callback
    function.
</menu>
<h3>unsigned int getCacheItemCount( Cache *cache )</h3>
<menu>
    This function returns the number of items (CacheDatas) in the cache.
</menu>

<h3>void * getValueForKey( Cache *cache , int key )</h3>
<menu>
    This function uses the search callback function to search the cache for a given
    key.  The cache is searched by NEWEST CacheData FIRST.
</menu>

</menu>

<h2>Example</h2>
<menu>
    Here is an (not-very-useful) example that uses the cache to store data that would wait to be
    stored in a database.  It's not a perfect example because each CacheData holds
    only one field in a database table instead of an entire record.  This is because
    it was simplified for clarity (the findItem() function becomes simpler, but the
    storeItem() function wouldn't work well as it is).  It would be simple to have the 
    CacheData hold records which could be structs that contain an array/list of struct 
    field.  The search function would have to be updated, of course.
    <pre>
    #include &lt;cache.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    /* This will be used for field naming/indexing/identification */
    enum
    {
        FIELD_NONE,
        
        FIELD_INDEX,
        FIELD_USERNAME,
        FIELD_PASSWORD,
        
        FIELD_COUNT
    };
    
    struct field
    {
        int fieldName; /* Holds on of the enum types above */
        char fieldData[80];
    };
    
    int storeItem( void *item , unsigned int size )
    {
        struct field *data = (struct field *) item;
    
        /* Code to store field to DB */
    
        return TRUE;
    }
    
    void * findItem( void *item , unsigned int size , int key )
    {
        struct field *data = (struct field *) item;
    
        if ( key == data->fieldName )
        {
            return data->fieldData;
        }
        
        return NULL;
    }
    
    int main( int argc , char **argv )
    {
        Cache *cache = createCache();
        struct field *data;
        unsigned int i = 0;
    
        setKeySearchFunction( cache , findItem );
        setCacheStoreFunction( cache , storeItem );
    
        do
        {
            /* Get values to fill 'data' */

            addItemToCache( cache , createCacheData( data , sizeof( struct field ) ) );
    
            i++;
        }
        while ( i < 100 );

        printf( "Items in cache:  %i\n" , getCacheItemCount( cache ) );

        /* This could, say, get the last user to log in */
        printf( "Last logon:  %s\n" , (char *) getValueForKey( cache , FIELD_USERNAME ) );
    
        while ( getCacheItemCount( cache ) )
        {
            storeItemInCache( cache );
        }
    
        return 0;
    }
