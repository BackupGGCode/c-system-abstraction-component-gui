char is neither equivalent to signed char or unsigned char, therefore this alias had to be created.</td></tr>

to conserve space, an attempt was made to make this _8... or even a 1 bit field, but it failed, and finally _32 was
chosen as the type of this.</td></tr>

<tr><td>CPOINTER</td><td>A pointer to void constant data.</td></tr>

manipulating this are in timers.h (timers library) for now.</td></tr>

<tr><td>GENERICSET, *GENERICSET</td><td>A set of fixed size data items.  Elements are slab allocated, and linked together to keep consistant pointers.  Data element
availability is tracked with a set of bits.  This set is often aliased with a set of user defined macros.  C++ encapsulation was elegant.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TEXT, PTEXT</td><td>A text item. It contains length of string, format of data, possibly posistion data, and next/prior text segments.  A sentance is actually a linked
list of TEXT elements each often representing a word.  Several methods of manipuplation of this type exist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>VARTEXT, PVARTEXT</td><td>A variable text item.  Its emphasis is not so much on format/data, but being able to expand dynamically.  Used almost exclusively with vtprintf
which is a formatted print to print into these elements.  VARTEXT generates PTEXT output.  PVARTEXT is a pointer to a VARTEXT type.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PTREEROOT</td><td>A binary tree.  The tree has definable comparison, destruction methods.</td></tr>
<tr><td>PTREENODE</td><td>A node within a binary tree.</td></tr>

<h2>Routines</h2>
This section is split into functional groups, based on the type of container 
structure they relate to.
<p>_Ex methods take debug information parameters.  These are then passed
into the allocate/deallocation routines, so that the user code is credited
for the allocation, not these library modules themselves.  The _Ex versions
may be called, if a routine wishes to actually credit some other code with
the allocate/deallocation.  If a non Ex version is used, then the current
application file-line(DBG_SRC) will be used, and a call will be generated to the Ex 
function.
<p>
All List, DataList, Stack, DataStack, Queue, DataQueue methods are intended multi-thread
and even multi-process safe.  There is a problem if a structure expands however
while the second accesses may be locked out, it cannot be aware of the new
location of the list...
There will NEVER occur a time that two threads
are able to manipulate the structures.  Several threads may be reading
the structure, and certain methods(macros) like LIST_FORALL() have no 
locking, another thread MAY delete a list being traversed by this macro.
If only actual routines are used, there should be no conflict.

<h3>List Methods</h3>
There is no enforcement that a list contains pointers of any specific
type.  Let the user beware.  Templates could solve this problem, at the
cost of much bloat, when the user should just be aware enough that a 
specific list is meant to contain a specific type of data.
<menu>
<h3>PLIST CreateListEx( DBG_VOIDPASS )<br>
PLIST CreateList(void)</h3>
<menu>
Creates a simple list which tracks pointers.
</menu>
<h3>PLIST DeleteListEx( PLIST *ppList DBG_PASS )<br>
PLIST DeleteList( PLIST *ppList )</h3>
<menu>
ppList is a pointer to the PLIST to destroy.  The result of this will set the
PLIST pointer to NULL.  The return should always be NULL being the resulting
pointer.  However, there may be occasions where the list cannot be deleted,
and therefore the result will be returned, and the value kept in PLIST.
</menu>
<h3>PLIST AddLinkEx( PLIST *ppList, POINTER p DBG_PASS )<br>
PLIST AddLink( PLIST *ppList, POINTER p )</h3>
<menu>
Adds a pointer into a list.  If the pointer is NULL, it will not be added.
No NULL values may be stored in this list structure.  PLIST* is a pointer
to a PLIST.  If the list is expanded, then this list reference pointer will
be updated to the newly allocated space.  The value set into the PLIST* will
also be returned.
</menu>
<h3>PLIST SetLinkEx( PLIST *ppList, INDEX idx, POINTER p DBG_PASS )<br>
PLIST SetLink( PLIST *ppList, INDEX idx, POINTER p )</h3>
<menu>
This sets the value of a pointer into a specific index in the list.
If the list is not yet large enough to have that value, it will be automatically
expanded to accomodate the new value.  A NULL value will effectively erase
an entry
</menu>
<h3>POINTER GetLink( PLIST *ppList, INDEX idx )</h3>
<menu>
Returns the linked stored in the list at the specified index.
</menu>
<h3>INDEX FindLink( PLIST *ppList, POINTER value )</h3>
<menu>
Searches for all entries in the list, and returns the index of the first item
which matches the value specified.
</menu>
<h3>int DeleteLink( PLIST *ppList, POINTER value )</h3>
<menu>
This is effectively the same as SetLink( ppList, FindLink( ppList, value ), NULL );
The result of this call is a boolean TRUE if the value was found and deleted
and FALSE if the value was not found to delete.
</menu>
<h3>typedef PTRSVAL (*ForProc)( PTRSZVAL user, INDEX idx, POINTER *item );<br>
PTRSZVAL ForAllLinks( PLIST *ppList, ForProc func, PTRSZVAL psv )</h3>
<menu>
The ForProc callback paramters gets the value specified in (psv) from the 
call to ForAllLinks;  the current index of the item; and a pointer to the 
memory containing the pointer data for the current link.  This allows the
callback to set directly into the list any new value.  If the callback
returns any non-zero value, the looping is aborted, and that value is 
returned to the caller of ForAllLinks.
<br>
A list is passed to be searched, a callback function specified, and a 
user data value.  The result is either 0, or the non-zero result of a 
call to ForProc().
</menu>

<h3>LIST_FORALL(list, index, type, var)</h3>
<menu>
This is not a function per-se, but a macro wrapper to go through all
items in a list.  It basically produces a for() loop construct inline.  At
this time LIST_ENDFORALL() may be omitted, once upon a time it contained
closing }'s which were left open by the LIST_FORALL() portion.<br><br>
list is a PLIST type to go through.  <br>
index is a variable of type INDEX which is declared by the caller<br>
type is the type of variable var (for C++ where typecasting must be explicitly done)<br>
var is the name of a variable to get the current value from the list<br><br>
At the end of the list, (var) SHOULD be NULL.  unless there was
a break within the loop.  If the list is NULL, the variable (var) may not
be NULL, and under certain other conditions.... <br>
<p><pre>
{
   PLIST list;
   INDEX idx;
   P_MY_TYPE myvar;
   LIST_FORALL( list, idx, P_MY_TYPE, myvar )
   {
      // code here can check myvar, which will never be NULL.
   }
}</pre>
