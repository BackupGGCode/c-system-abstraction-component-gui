Accounts.data options are as follows

Any '#' on a line will mark a comment on that line.  Any line which
contains only spaces after removing the comment is not considered a
configuration line.

login=<login name>

  A 'client' relay will have a name which it uses to identify itself to
the server.  This determines which directory set on the server to put
items into, and where items come from.

user=<account name>

  user followed by a list of incoming/outgoing directories... This
defines which login names are allowed to connect.  Based on the login
name, different incoming/outgoing directories are specified.

  if login= is specified (denotes a client configuration) - the only
valid user= name is 'datamirror', which then defines the
incoming/outgoing files for this, after logging into the 'master'
relay.

listen=IP

   Specifies interface IP which this account can be connected thru. 
This is not the same as allow= which specifies which IPs can be connected
from.

allow=

  Unused field.  Intended to list which source IPs can connect here.
(Not the same as listen= which specifies the local interface connected
to).  This is a per-user setting.

incoming=

  A directory into which to put files inbound to this account.  This is
a per-user setting.


outgoing=

  A directory and optional filemask to send on this account.

  If the last part of the name (after the last / or \ ) -  contains a ?
or * will be treated as a mask of files within that directory.  *
matches 0 or more characters, ? matches any one character.

  This is a per-user setting.

winners=

  If dekware= option is enabled, this is the port to connect to
(localhost) to get the current list of winners.  Dekware in this
instance is a parsing agent which scans Orion Bingo Caller logs and
lists which cards have won.  This is a per-user setting.


broadcast=0/1

  Specifies whether to broadcast data received from the server relay. 
(The broadcast data is game packets generated by the caller)

dekware=0/1 

  Specifies whether to connect to a dekware parsing agent to get the
list of winners (winners= port).

splashman=0/1  

  Specified whether to connect to a local splashman to set connection
status.  

forcecase=[Ll]ow 

  Linux option mostly - but this allows the case of received filenames
to be forced to lower case.  Maybe (but probably not) there could be
support in this option to force upper?

Any other line is an unknown configuration line.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Some operational theory.  Neither the directory which a file came from
(outgoing) or the directory which a file goes into (incoming) is ever
sent between relays.  Only the names of the files sent are transmitted.
This allows the server to dissociate itself from the client, and put
the file into whatever directory it wants based on per-client options.

The only flaw in this scheme - at the moment - if the incoming
directory order or the outgoing directory order is different between
client and server, flies will not end up where one thinks they should
go.  The first outgoing on the server matches the first incoming on the
client, and vice versa....

---------------------------------------------------------------------

A simple configuration for a server.

user=caller
outgoing=/path/to/tickets
outgoing=/path/to/sessctrl
incoming=/path/to/prizes

user=pos
incoming=/path/to/tickets
incoming=/path/to/sessctrl
outgoing=/path/to/prizes


the sample caller configuration...

login=caller
incoming=c:\xyzzyx\data\Game\tickets
incoming=c:\xyzzyx\sessctrl
outgoing=c:\xyzzyx\data\prize*

the sample pos configuration ...

login=pos
outgoing=c:\xyzzyx\data\Game\tickets
outgoing=c:\xyzzyx\data\sessctrl 
incoming=c:\xyzzyx\data


Some things to note ... 

the login of pos deteremines on the server which directories are
incoming and outgoing.  The order of these does not matter - except
that they must match the inverse outgoing/incoming on the other side...
So the POS has 2 outgoing which goes to the server's 2 incoming and one
incoming which matches the servers outgoing.
