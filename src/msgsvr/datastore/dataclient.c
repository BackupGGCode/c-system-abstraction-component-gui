// useful client implementation of storing shared, updating structures
// on a common server (with delayed transation to other systems, and near-realtime
// updates to in-system shared members )
//  - with a little help from the kernel we could store these minor
// members, and relate things with even less latency...

// this accounts for seperate processes with self-dependant offset ordering
// hmmm

// why don't I just use shared mem?

// oh these regions - these types - they have a name associated with them...
