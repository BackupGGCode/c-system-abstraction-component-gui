need to define the rules for how peices react...

name (id?) type

block - 3x3

connector set - 7x7 grid of all ends and conenctors
  given a dyanmic board size based on user grid size...

cell size 16x16  

#%enum static shade multishade

block neuron images/neuron.gif 3x3 multishade
block input images/input.gif 3x3 shade
block output images/output.gif 3x3 shade
connector nerves input/master1.gif static 


when loading I need to be notified when a peice is added so that I may associat an internal 
handle, and/or define further attributes about a peice

layers may connect to shadows

connector set both ends are layers
but then shadows have content...



peice - master image, draw method
layer - draw parameters, relation to real drawings, referece to peice or peice part
board - default peice type - background - may be nothing, but then the application will
   have no surface upon which to get events...
