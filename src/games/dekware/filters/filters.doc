
Filters
-----------

NIL -
   Does no translation - is no use other than to test passing of data, events,
   destruction of filter layers, and to be a shell for other filters.

ANSI - 
	Decode ansi position, color codes and removes from the stream
	May also take current segment attributes and produce ansi data for output
	Options to this filter include
	   Inbound - data is from 'outer' heading to 'core' object
	   Outbound - data is from the object heading out
	   Encode - checkes segment formatting and introduces data reflecting changes
	   Decode - analyzes data inbound for escape sequences and produces format changes

IRC - 
	Will be similar to the ansi plugin bug handlign IRC type attributes.

Binary -
   Useful filter for analyzing data streams - will convert any data to
   hex equivalents (16 characters wide) and matching ascii representation.
   Options may include
   	Inbound
   	Outbound

Grouper -
	This attempts to pair matching quotes, braces, brackets, et al.  Resulting
	in segemts with attributes indirected with content data.

tokenizer -
   Generic filter to produce tokenized data... This classically was done 
   for each device by itself, but this will simplify their work a bit... and
   commonize how this is done.
