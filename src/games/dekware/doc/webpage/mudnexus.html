<li>Aug 2, 2002 - Implemented <a href="commands.html#on">/on (enter/leave)</a> trigger macros on objects.  
<li>Jan 28, 2003 - Long time since I've updated news... Many improvements overall
in perfomance, features, and stability.  Common datapath filters have been 
designed now, providing much more plugable/stackable command/data processing 
interface.  Changes just go on and on....
<li>Sep 16, 2001 - Fixed recall to scroll partial parts of long, wrapped lines.
Fixed keybindings.  Fixed output of Ping, Trace, Whois.  Added command paste. 
Updated menu to make more sense.  Fixed command recall and edit with backspace
and delete.  Added /CLEAR to trigger plugin.
<li>Aug 15, 2001 - Fixed trigger handling - stops processing data and allows
triggered commands to execute before resuming read.  Many small fixes regarding 
plugin loading, and portability changes.</li>
<li>May 1, 2001 - Added new Windows Console plugin.  Added a file logging
device.  New commands in all consoles.  <a href="new_features.html">New features</a>
<li>March 20, 2001 - Added ability to change <a href="variables.html#builtin">prompt</a>.
Added macro <a href="plugin_console.html">binding to
keys</a>.    Improved unix console interface(Unix version soon to be posted).
Added methods to objects to support card game plugin.  Methods are internal
code routines attached much like macros, but preempt internal commands, allowing
objects to override default command behavior.
Many minor updates and inproved stability.
<li>Sept 11, 2000 - Updated information about triggers, and usage as a MUD client.
<li>June 23, 2000 - Homepage begins

<a href="basic.html">Click here</a> for a quick coverage of basic macros and triggers.
<p>The default script files, 'macros' and 'connect', provide instant connectivity
to most MUDs.
<p>/connect &lt;mud address&gt;
<p>A mud address is IP and PORT.  If only the name is used, the default port
of telnet(23) will be used.  "/connect ip.mud.com:1234" - would connect
to a mud at ip.mud.com using port 1234.  
<p>Commands to Nexus are always preceeded by a '/'.  Commands meant to be 
sent to the connection, which need a '/' may be additionally
prefixed with a '.'.  
<menu>
   ./name my_new_name
</menu>

<p>Any command entered, that is not an internal command, valid
macro, or a plugin command
will be sent to current connection.
If the line had a leading '/' the '/' is not
sent to the connection.
<p>The <a href="plugin_console.html">console</a> interface provides a line
based interface.  Arrow keys allow you to recall and edit commands.  Although
there is no visual indication the insert key will toggle between insert and 
overwrite mode when editing commands.  The up arrow recalls a command, the down arrow 
will go to the next command after a previously recalled command....
<p><a href="script.html">Scipts</a> for <a href="script_macros.html">macros</a>
and <a href="plugin_trigger.html">triggers</a> enhance the MUD experience,
allowing repative and/or automatic actions to be taken.  
When writing macros to send commands to a MUD, either '.' prefix on lines or
the '/send' command provided by the <a href="plugin_terminal.html">terminal plugin</a> may be used.

<P>In its infancy DekWare resembled a MUD;  allowing the user to create
abstract objects.&nbsp;  Today it provides a powerful scripting language
and allows merging of networks, files, 3D virtual
environments, and ODBC/SQL databases into a homogeneous unity.&nbsp;
Future expansion and additional functionality can be added through
plugin modules, and scripts.&nbsp; 

<P>To this day, Nexus has become a web page parser, a MUD client, a 
weather notice processor, and generally a tool to model object oriented
design and implementation.&nbsp; It is a general purpose command processor,
with easy extensibility through plugins.&nbsp; Plugin modules can provide 
additional devices, add additional commands, and may extend basic objects.
