<p>More information about macros: <a href="macros.html">Macros</a>
<p>Some very important things to remember!  Once a macro is defined it cannot
be re-created without first destroying it.  If you attempt to create a macro
with a name that is already a macro in a script, all the commands following the 
command '/macro duplicate_name' will be executed and not recorded as a macro.
It is advised that you first issue a /destroy command before defining a macro.
<menu>
/destroy newmac<br>
/macro newmac<br>
/echo Hello, World.<br>
/endmac<br>
</menu>
Macros may be defined to have parameters...
<MENU>
/macro test name password
</MENU>
The previous command will start recording a macro named test with parameters
name and password.  If creating a macro at a command prompt, the macro name
will show in parentheses after your current object and current location.
Parameters are referenced within a macro by preceeding 
their name with a '%'.  In this case %name would be the first parameter, and
%password the second.  Also parameters may be referenced by position %0 being
the first, %1, %2, etc. being susequent parameters.  Any line entered after
the /macro statement will be added to the macro.  
<menu>
/endmacro
</menu>
The previous command stops recording the macro.  The command processor in
Nexus will accept partial match of commands.  Any macros which have been defined
must be executed with their entire name.
<p>Several commands in Nexus are only available within a macro: Label, Goto, if, 
else, Endif, and return.
