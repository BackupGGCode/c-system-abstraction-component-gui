<p>It is possible to do a lot without any additional objects.&nbsp;  The first
aware object, MOOSE, can be useful by itself.  
<p>/script "filename"
<p>SCRIPT allows commands to be input from a file.&nbsp; Before the first 
command from a user is able to be processed, MOOSE performs a
"/script macros" command.&nbsp;
The commands from the file 'macros' are read, and queued to be processed.&nbsp;
SCRIPT commands are treated as if they were entered at a command prompt.&nbsp;
If there is a '#' on a line, the remaining portion of the line is ignored,
allowing script files to have comments.

<p>/macro test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Define a test macro<br>
#/echo test entered<br>
/endmac&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#end the test macro
<p>The prior set of commands creates an empty macro called test in the current
active object.&nbsp;  Macros are stored on/in objects, not in the awareness
controlling them.
<p>/declare one Hello<br>
/declare two World<br>
<p>DECLARE creates named variables in an object.&nbsp; Variables are referenced
by putting a '%' before their name. '%one' would essentially be the same
as 'Hello'.&nbsp; 
<p>/destroy test #remove previous definition (if any) of test.<br>
/macro test param1 param2<br>
/decl local I'm a purple mouse!<br>
/echo %one %two. %local<br> 
/echo %param1 %param2<br>
/endmac
<p>DECLARE when used in a macro creates a variable which is only valid 
during the time of the macro.&nbsp;
