   <menu> 
   The trigger device is used only with other devices, and it is not 
   possible to use this device alone.&nbsp;
      Internally this creates a device which it uses to relay from the actual
      data input path to the object.  During the relay of information it processes
      for possible trigger conditions.&nbsp; If the data datapath is not currently
      open, it is impossible to create triggers.&nbsp; The object must have 
      opened a device to be PARSEd.&nbsp; Trigger may also not be used on 
      datapaths which have issued /FORMAT binary.

   TRIGGER
   <menu>
      <U>Operations</U><br>
      <li>Create [Trigger] [Template]<br>
      <menu>
   Begins recording a new trigger on the currently open device.&nbsp; The 
   template controls when the trigger actions are performed.  If a word in
          the template is prefixed with an '&' then the word may be referenced
          as a variable within the command.&nbsp; This allows words to be wild 
          carded, and passed as parameters to the trigger commands.&nbsp; 

     Recording is done like macro commands.&nbsp; All commands entered
     after the recording is started are added to the list of commands
     to perform when the trigger template matches incoming data.&nbsp; 
     Recording is ended with the /ENDMACRO command.
          <p>Example:<menu> /trigger create lookat &who looks at you.<br>
         .say Hi, %who!<br>
         /endmacro<br>
         Incoming line like "Bobby looks at you" will invoke the commands
         defined for the trigger.
      </menu>
      Also, a word in the template may be prefixed with a '*'.  If this 
      is used instead of an '&', then one or more words may be matched.
      The word following the '*' may be used as a parameter in the commands
      which follow.
      <p>Example:<menu>/trigger crea aurafade the white glow around *what body fades.<br>
         .echo succeeded in dispelling %what.<br>
         /endmac<br>
         Incoming line like "the white glow around the Spirit of El-Alifam's body fades"
         will invoke the commands, and echo "succeeded in dispelling the Spirit of El-Alifam's"
         which may be incorrect, but can be fixed possibly using more commands
         like /HEAD, /TAIL, etc...
      </menu>
      <br><li>Clear<br>
      <menu>
      	Removes all defined triggers.
      </menu>
      <br><li>Destroy [Trigger] ...
      <menu>
         Destroys a defined trigger on the currently open device.&nbsp; 
   Multiple triggers may be listed, and all in the list will be destroyed.
      </menu>
      <br><li>Option [trigger] [options...]<br>
   <menu>
     Although the trigger name is required, if no options are specified, 
          the current option set is displayed.&nbsp; 
     Options which are in upper case are SET, lower case options are CLEAR. 
     SET usually indicates a non-default value. 
   <br><br>
   <U>Optional options</u>

      <menu>
          Disable - Disables a trigger from being checked.<br>
     Enable(*) - Enables a trigger.<br>
          Anchor - forces a trigger to only check the beginning of a line<br>
          Free(*) - allows the template phrase to appear anywhere on a line.<br>
     Multi(*) - allows the trigger to fire always... disables Once options.<br>
          Once - Forces a trigger to disable after it happens once.<br>
     OnceOff - Forces a trigger to disable and then enable after it happens once.<br>
     Exact - forces a strict case match on template versus data.<br>
     Similar(*) - allows a non-case sensative compare on template.<br>
     Pass(*) - allow trigger to forward data.<br>
     Consume - if the trigger happens, do not pass the data through.<br><br>
     (*) - these are default options when a trigger is created.
   </menu>
      </menu>
      <menu>
      </menu>
      <br><li>List [trigger]
   <menu>
     If no trigger name is specified, all triggers on the current open
     data datapath are listed.&nbsp; If the trigger name is specified,
     then the trigger name, template, current options, and all commands
     it would perform are displayed.
   </menu>
      <br><li>Help
   <menu>
      Help lists trigger sub-commands.
   </menu>
   <br><li>Store [file]
   <menu>
   Stores all current variables on the object, and all current triggers 
   into the file name specified.&nbsp; This file is then able to be used
   with the /script command to reload the trigger set.&nbsp; This command
   is similar to the /STORE command which stores the current variables
   and current macros on this object.
   </menu>
   <br><li>Trip [trigger] [parameters]
   <menu>
   This command is currently not implemented, but would allow one to
   cause a trigger to happen.&nbsp; Would have to specify all parameters
   required for the trigger.
