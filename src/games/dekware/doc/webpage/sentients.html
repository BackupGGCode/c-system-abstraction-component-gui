<p>Objects which are aware (made active via the WAKE command) have two
datapaths; the command datapath, and the data datapath.&nbsp; A datapath is a 
queue or stream of lines.&nbsp; The command datapath is where the objects
gets it's orders to perform.&nbsp; The default command path is not assigned
to a device, therefore the only way to issue commands is to TELL the object
commands to perform.&nbsp;  The COMMAND command will assign the command 
datapath to a device.&nbsp; 
The data datapath is a stream from a device, and may be accessed using GETLINE,
GETWORD, and GETPARTIAL.&nbsp; An object may only have 
one device opened for a datapath.&nbsp; More information on using devices
is in the next section.&nbsp; This section only details very basic usage of
aware objects.
<p>First, set up some things....
<menu>/create shelf<br>
/grab shelf<br>
/drop shelf</menu>
<p>Create an agent object...
<menu>/create agent</menu>
<p>Creates an object called agent (contained within MOOSE).&nbsp; One option 
is to use the current awareness to control the new object...
<menu>/become agent</menu>
<p>The become command allows you to change what object is the one considered
'active' for this sentience.&nbsp; Only objects which can be seen and
are inactive are valid targets for this command.&nbsp; For possible result 
messages please look at the command reference.&nbsp; The other method for 
activating an object is to give it an awareness of its own...
<menu>/wake agent</menu>
<p>Probably one of the most important actions, WAKE gives an inanimate object
a sentience, an ability to perform actions for itself.&nbsp; An object which
has been awoken, cannot be the target of the BECOME command.&nbsp; The
object which has become aware, now can be given commands via the TELL command.
<menu>/tell agent /create book<br>
 -or-<br>
/agent/create book</menu>
<p>Alternativly, if the object name does not overlap a command or macro for
the current object, the object may be references as a command.&nbsp; Anything
following the /[object name] part of the command is passed to the object as
if TELL was used.&nbsp;
The tell command requires the name of an object and a command line to give
that object.&nbsp; If the object is not aware, or is not visible, a message
reflecting this is generated.&nbsp; Once an object been contacted with a TELL,
subsequent command may be shorted to "//".&nbsp; If the commands to the object
cause the object to no longer be 'visible' to the commanding object, the commands
will still be told to the object.
<menu>//grab book <br>
//leave <br>
//enter shelf </menu>
<p>At this point, MOOSE cannot see 'agent' but commands using '//' will still 
be told to the agent...
<menu>//drop book<br>
//leave<br>
/look in shelf </menu>
<p>Note this last command has a single '/', this is a command to be performed
for the current active object.&nbsp; MOOSE will look into the shelf and list 
the contents...
<menu>shelf contains: book.</menu>
