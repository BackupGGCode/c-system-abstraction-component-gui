<P>In the beginning there is nothing.&nbsp;  Only The Void.&nbsp;
Out of the void the first
sentience is created.&nbsp; The first sentient object is called 'MOOSE'.&nbsp;
This is an acronym standing
for "Master Operator Of System Entities".&nbsp;
This first object, aware and able to process commands, is assigned to a(the)
console device, is an avatar in the nothingness.
You can create more objects.&nbsp; The command /create
followed by a one or more things to create, will create all the objects
specified.&nbsp; If the name contains spaces or punctuation, quotes
may be put around it.
<P>/create shelf two three "A small green book"
<P>Results in MOOSE holding three objects called 'one', 'two', 'three' and
'A small green book'.&nbsp; All objects which are created start within
the object creating them.
<P>/grab shelf two
<P>Moves the objects, 'shelf' and 'two', from inventory (contents),
and attaches them to the active object.&nbsp;  An attached
object can be considered held.&nbsp; 
<P>/drop shelf
<P>Detaches the object 'shelf' and puts it in the room you are currently in.&nbsp;
The command prompt indicates [&lt;your current location&gt;/&lt;object you are acting as&gt;].
<P>/look
<p>shows objects near you.  First the room name is shown, next things that are
near you in the same room are listed, followed by objects attached to the
room you are in.&nbsp; Objects which are attached to your room are considered
rooms near here.
<p>/inventory
<p>Many commands can be shortened to the least amount of characters which 
would make it different from all other commands, ie INV for inventory.&nbsp;
This command displays objects being held and objects contained by the current
active object.
<p>/enter shelf
<p>Enter allows you to go within an object.&nbsp; Valid targets to be entered
are things in the same room, or attached to the current room.
<p>/grab "A small green book"<BR>
/drop "A small green book"<br>
/leave
<p>Leave exits the the current room and enters the object containing the 
current room.&nbsp; Enter and Leave are the only methods an object may
move itself.&nbsp; An active object may be grabbed, dropped, or stored by
another active object, thereby changing its location...
<p>/rename two "Another book"
<p>Once an object is created, it can be renamed...&nbsp;  
<p>/describe shelf A sturdy oak shelf for books.
<p>Describe allows you to add more description to created objects and 
comments for macros.  
<p>/enter shelf<br>
/drop "Another Book"<br>
/leave
<p>Now /look shows there is a shelf in the room. 
<p>/look shelf
<p>Shows the shelf, its description, and the things which are attached to or
held by the shelf.<br>
<menu>
shelf<br>
A sturdy oak shelf for books.<br>
shelf is holding: Nothing.
</menu>
<p>/look in shelf
<p>Looking IN an object shows the objects which it holds.&nbsp; It does not
show it's name, or description.<br>
<menu>shelf contains: A small green book, Another book.</menu>
<p>/destroy three
<p>A long time ago MOOSE created an object three, which remained contained 
within.&nbsp; Since we do not need this object, it would be handy to remove
it from existance.&nbsp; DESTROY is what is needed.&nbsp;  This command only
destroys all objects (or macros) listed - any contents or attached objects are dropped
into the object containing the object destroyed... dropped into the same 
room.
<p>This concludes information about the objects.  Object creation; modification -
 by rename and describe; destruction, manipulation -
 grab, store and drop; relocation - enter, leave;
 browsing - look, look in and inventory; and a quick introduction to aware
 objects.&nbsp; For further informatin, consult the command reference, or
 the scripting reference.&nbsp;

 <p><p>There are more methods of manipulating objects... Attach, Detach, Join...
 these are still under development, as they have not benn entirely nessecary...
 Information on these commands may be found in the Command Reference...
