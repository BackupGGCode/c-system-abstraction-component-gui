<menu>
<li>window
<menu>Windows standard MDI type interface.  Supports multiple client windows
which can be tiled, uses ctrl-tab to switch between sub-windows.  alt-v paste,
no mark/copy (to be done - eventually).  Device does line buffering (terminated with \n).</menu>
<li>psicon
<menu>Windows/Linux gui type interface.  Limited functionality for multiple
windows.  Uses SDL(patched) as it's base interface, giving a graphical interface
to X, framebuffer, SVGALib(untested), etc... Under windows, uses the native 
windowing environment, under linux, it is constrained to one display surface,
within which it can open multiple client displays.
<li>console
<menu>Text command prompt-like console input.  On NT family systems, this 
can support up to 9999 lines of history, uses default system copy/cut/paste
mechanisms. Device does line buffering (terminated with \n).</menu>
<li>cursecon
<menu>On Unix type systems (Linux/FreeBSD) this is a console environment which
uses curses to display active information.  Supports pg-up/pg-down type scrollback
standard X terminal type copy/paste.  Can be in line mode or direct mode.  
Line mode implies a command line seperate from the result data.  Direct mode
implies entering commands in place on the display. Device does line buffering (terminated with \n).</menu>
<li>file
<menu>Input from a file. Opening the device required device specific parameter 
filename.  
<p>Optional paramaters: <menu>
<li> __input opens the file for read. 
<li> __output opens the file for writing - sets 
the position at the end of the file, and takes no input from the file, all
output is appended to the end of the file. 
<li> If __input only then the file is opened for reading only, and positioned
at the beginning of the file.
<li> If __output only, then the file is created for writing.  (Any prior file
content is destroyed).
<li> If __input and __output__ then the file is opened for read or write, and
the current position is set at the end of the file (for append).
</menu>
<p>All tokens after the device name (and after
optional __input parameter) are taken as the file name.
Device input is in line format, with terminating \n.
If there are \r characters they are also present.
<p>Options available after open: <menu>
<li> close - When reading the file, and the end of file is encountered,
 the device automatically closes.  Any filters also open on the file are closed
 until the next 'data source' type device.
<li> follow - When reading the file, when the end of the file is encountered, 
wait for more data, at which time, read and return the next data.
<li> relay - Data from devices further down the open device list from this 
is relayed as input.&nbsp; Typically this would be used when there's a file
for input open, and then this file is opened for output.  Data input from the
file beyond would be relayed in, but of course any data outbound would be
written into the open output file.
</menu>
</menu>
<li>tcp
<menu>Input from a tcp socket device.  Parameter required is the address 
to connect to, in 'standard' IP:PORT format.  IP may be a name or numeric.
Port may be a service name or numeric.
Input is a block of data, up to 4096 
characters.  No formatting is done at this level.</menu>
<li>tcpserver
<menu>Opens a port for listening.  Parameter requiried is the port number 
to listen on.  This may also have the IP specified, if the machine is mutli-homed.
Input is a block of data up to 4096 characters, no formatting is done.</menu>
<li>udp
<menu>Recieve and transmit on a specified UDP port.  (mostly untested).  
Input is the message block, prefixed by special binary data containing the IP and
PORT of the sender.</menu>
<li>udpserver
<menu>Recieve and transmit on a specified UDP port.  (mostly untested).  
Input is the message block, prefixed by special binary data containing the IP and
PORT of the sender.</menu>
<li>system
<menu>A quite abstract device, but is used to launch system commands.  Also
tied directly to the <a href="commands.html">'!' command</a>.  Input is whatever
is available from the system up to 4096 characters.  Could be used to host
a command shell.  Certain compatibility issues between Win9x and NT family
cause this command to not work right.  Currently seems to work under Linux.
<br><br>/open system dir # results in the current directory listing</menu>
<br><br>
</menu>
<menu><center><font size=+1><u>Filters</u></font></center><br>
<li>token
<menu>Tokenizes a stream into pure <a href="parser.html">tokens</a>.  Lines are
gathered, and terminated with special EOL tokens.  Command processing requires
that input be at least tokenized.</menu>  
<li>telnet
<menu>Handles special telnet IAC codes, results mostly in WON'T responces, and
provides information to satisfy some of the more strict telnet servers.  Removes
telnet IAC codes from input stream, otherwise provides no formatting.</menu>
<li>split
<menu>splits the datapath to another object.  Can be used to monitor other
processes processing data, or to run multiple combinations of events from the 
same stream.  
	<li>Optional parameters<menu>
	  <li>both - splits inbound and outbound data to 
destination.
     <li>inbound - splits only the inbound data to the destination.
     <li> outbound - splits only outbound data to the destination.
     <li> outtoin - outbound data becomes inbound on the destination.
     <li> intoout - inbound data becomes outbound on the destination.
   </menu>
	<li>Required parameter: [object] an object currently visible from the current object. 
		the object specified must have at least one 'merge' filter to accept the split.
		The data datapath channel is searched and then the command datapath.
</menu>
<li>merge
<menu>
Accepts information split from another object's datastream via the split filter.
</menu>
<li>splice
<menu>Gathers all tokens on a line, into one line, with \r\n termination.
   <li>Optional parameters<menu>
	   <li>inbound - data which is inbound is spliced.
	   <li>outbound - data which is outbound is spliced.
	</menu>
</menu>
<li>sink
<menu>Any outbound data is consumed, relays all input data.</menu>
<li>nil
<menu>Does nothing.  Input relayed, output relayed.  Merely a skeleton for other 
filters.</menu>
<li>debug
<menu>Dumps extended information about data being relayed.  Optional paramters:
inbound - dumps inbound data, outbound - dumps outbound data.</menu>
<li>binary
<menu>Dumps binary of data being relayed.  Optional paramters:
inbound - dumps inbound data, outbound - dumps outbound data.
    <li>Optional Parameters<menu>
	    <li>inbound - data inbound through the filter will be translated to 
	       a binary dump.
	    <li>outbound - data outbound through the filter will be translate to
	       a binary dump.
	    <li>log - Data which is converted to a binary dump will be shown in 
	       dekware.log, and will not be output to the next device in line.
    </menu>
</menu>
<li>bash
<menu>Handles bash-like parsing/tokenizing.  Gathers lines from seperate 
segments.  Formatting of data allows passing of typically unrepresentable
characters.  
	<li>\x## is a hex character, 
	<li>\0ooo is an octal representation of a character
	<li>\. is a NIL character, generates no data, but forces a seperation between tokens,
	<li>\$ literal $
	<li>\" literal quote
	<li>\' literal single quote
	<li>\\ literal back slash
	<li>\&nbsp; a literal space... (that's backslash-blank)
	<li>\; literal ; otherwise ; seperates commands into seperate lines
	<li>\n newline character
	<li>\t tab character
	<li>" " or ' ' - double and single quotes will collect all data between them
	    into a single token.  The quotes surrounding the data are lost.
	<li>$variable resolves the variable using standard methods, and puts that value
	   directly in.  This allows the substitution to be done at the command-entry 
	   level instead of waiting until it gets to the object-core.
	<li># begins a comment until the end of the line.  All information
	    until the end of line (a newline character) is ignored.
	<li>Optional Parameters<menu>
		<li>noblank - On input there will be no blank lines arriving.  Every
		line will have at least some non blank data.
	</menu>

</menu>   
<li>ansi
<menu>
	<li>Optional Parameters<menu>
	   <li>inbound - inbound data is processed for ansi escape sequences.
	   <li>outbound - outbound data is processed for ansi escape sequences.
	   <li>encode - instead of decoding ansi escape sequences, the data is
	      encoded to ansi codes...&nbsp; This is useful for setting up a telnet
	      server to which data would be echoed as converted escape sequences.&nbsp;
	      If encode is not specified default method is decode.&nbsp;  Encode is
	      specified seperatly after inbound and outbound to select encoding
	      on each path.
	   <li>__keepnewline - No effect... supposedly this would keep the end of line
	        data...
	</menu>

Ansi codes are parsed out ( &lt;esc&gt;[#;...l ) - escape, bracket, number 
parameters seperated by semi-colons, followed by a single character.  These
sequences are removed from the input stream.  
All other codes are irrelavent and therefore are ignored.

<li>&lt;esc&gt;[#;#r - Set scroll region on display
<li>&lt;esc&gt;[6n - Return current cursor position with &lt;esc&gt;[#;#R.
<li>&lt;esc&gt;[#;#H or &lt;esc&gt;[#;#f - if #;# are both present, use 
   that as the row;col.  If both are missing, treat as a home-cursor command.
<li>&lt;esc&gt;[#A - if # present go up that many lines.  Else go up 1 line. 
<li>&lt;esc&gt;[#B - if # present go down that many lines.  Else go down 1 line.

<li>&lt;esc&gt;[#D - if # present go left that many columns.  Else go left 1 column.
<li>&lt;esc&gt;[#d - Set current line.  If # is not specifed go to top line.
<li>&lt;esc&gt;[#G - Set current column.  If # is not specifed go to first(left) column line.
<li>&lt;esc&gt;[#J - if # is not specified or is 0, Clear to end of page.  
		If # is 1 Clear to start of page.  If # is 2 Clear page (entire page, including data scrolled off)
<li>&lt;esc&gt;[#P - Delete # characters.  If # is not specified delete 1.
<li>&lt;esc&gt;[#K - if # is not specified or is 0, Clear to end of line.  
		If # is 1 Clear to start of line.  If # is 2 Clear current line.

<menu>
	Some operations like set scroll region do not yet work correctly.  Most
	everything else does seem to work.

<hr><br>
On windows, using the runwin.exe, to create another object one would do
<menu>
/create object<br>
/wake object<br>
/tell object /command interface window<br>
/tell object /command parser bash<br>
</menu>
'object' can be replace with any object name.  This creates an object named 
'object', wakes it up (allows it to process commands) tells it to open a 
window as its command input, and then tells it to open the filter 'bash' on
its command input.  If the object is to be blindly controlled, one does not
need to give it any command datapath devices, can still /tell commands to it.
