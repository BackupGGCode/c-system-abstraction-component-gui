<center><font size=+3>New Features</font></center>
<p><font size=+1>Version 2.3.2 - Released 08/02/03</font>
<menu>
	<li>Implemented <a href="commands.html#on">/on behavior definitions</a>.
	<li>Improved poker card evaluator (work in progress)
</menu>
<p><font size=+1>Version 2.3.1 - Released 04/27/03</font>
<menu>
	<li>Imroved stablity/consistancy of user interface.  
	<li>Mark/copy is now available for most user interfaces.
	<li>Implemented new interface based on PSI (panther's slick interface).
	<li>Stabelized memory usage to avoid memory leakage.
	<li>Modified /script command to perform much more in-line in how it processes scripts.
	    Previously /script would have loaded an entire script into the command queue, and then 
	    as it processed each subsequence /script command it would in turn load that into the command 
	    queue.  Now, script processing is suspended at each /script until the script to be loaded 
	    had completed all commands.
	<li>Modified script to be an internal macro using 'standard' bash command parsing (which is what
	    most user interfaces use.
</menu>

<p><font size=+1>Version 2.2d - Released </font>
<menu>
	<li>Updated documentation
	<li>Scripts are now handled using standard command input/filters  (file, bash)
	<li>/getline without a parameter reads into the macro result (/getresult)
	<li>/burst without parameter reads the macro result param, performs it's 
	    operation, and then stores the result back in the macro result.
	<li>/execute without parameter takes the macro result and queues it as a command.
	<li>/RUN added - forces a macro to perform all commands before processing
	    direct command input.
	<li>For Linux, Postgresql interface has been built (basically).
	<li>Current build system preferred for windows is Visual Studio.Net.
	<li>Many unaccounted changes between last doc update.
	<li>Added __output attribute to the 'file' device
	<li> ------ same day fixes -------
	<li>New script processing caused aliases created with scripts to be closed
	    when the script file ended.  A fix in triggers allows triggers as a device
	    to be opened, and a fix in 'macros' to associate by default a alias path
	    allows it to be around 'behind' script file/bash devices.
	<li>Cleaned up memory leaks - left with just one allocated block at exit.
	<li>Enabled triggers/aliases to be always /RUN - forced completion
</menu>
<p><font size=+1>Version 1.0b18 - Released </font>
<menu>
	<li>Fixed permitting deletion of running triggers, that is, they will 
	    complete before being deleted.
	<li>Fixed some double object deletions (very bad).
	<li>Added raw format to socket devices, and to system device and the log 
	    file.
	<li>Added /Relay - will stop processing all commands, and merely relay 
	    command input to data output and data input to command output.
	<li>Added __raw command option to ! (/parse system) so the read/write to 
	    the launched program is totally unprocessed.
	<li>Fixed destruction of triggers while they were running... previously
	    it would be possible to continue running a trigger that no longer
	    existed.
</menu>
<p><font size=+1>Version 1.0b17 - Released Sep 16, 2001</font>
<menu>
	<li>Fixed clearing multi-arg trigger flags.
	<li>Changed /trigger list <trigger> to indicate multi-args with [name] 
	    and single word args with (name).
	<li>Added CurseCon plugin for Unix type systems to use curses to display.
	<li>Added a mode in Windows console, direct, which will allow direct command
	    entry instead of forcing a line buffer.  
	<li>Fixed loading scripts from other paths /script /path/other/scriptfile.
	<li>Fixed code to generate %now and %time on Unix type systems.
	<li>Fixed triggers to force a trigger to complete before relaying more
	    data.  This can be disabled using /trigger option RUN.  
	<li>Ported timer.nex clock/stopwatch plugin to Unix.
	<li>Fixed end of line detection in terminal plugin.  Multiple carriage
	    returns at the end of a line would result in a carriage return
	    being generated in the returned buffer.  \r\r\n\r\r will properly
	    generate a single new line.  If a line such as "text \r text\r\n" 
	    is recieved, a buffer with a carriage return in the middle will be
	    generated... and probably not display correctly on a curses, or 
	    console mode windows display.  
	<li>Include a utility "strip" to remove carriage returns when 
		 porting/building on a unix system.
	<li>/COLLAPSE &lt;var reference&gt; - collapses a variables content into a single
	    string, this is useful for building macro/trigger names from other 
	    variables.
	<li>/DUMP &lt;entity&gt; - shows debug/diagnostic information about an entity.
	<li>/DUMPVAR &lt;text/variable&gt; - shows debug/diagnostic information about a
	    string or variable - useful to know how default parsing works, or how
	    a variable might behave if collapsed.
	<li>fixed '!' prefix on commands to launch system commands - this is actually
	    an alias for /parse system &lt;command&gt; lauches a system command as a data
	    stream, able to be used with /getword, /getline, etc, and able to use
	    triggers, logs, etc.  Actually /getword is the same as getline, no
	    parsing is done on the stream, however /burst command might be used to
	    seperate it to words, and /head, /tail will get the words.
	<li>/ALIAS new command - similar to TRIGGER however, works on data from
	    command input.	
	<li>Fixed device close conditions.
</menu>
<p><font size=+1>Version 1.0b16 - Released Sep 16, 2001</font>
<menu>
	<li>Fixed command editing.
	<li>Added CLEAR to /trigger.
	<li>Fixed history in windows console plugin, will now scroll over
	    parts of wrapped lines.
	<li>Added Paste.  Alt-V current is defined as paste, also available
	    on the menu.
	<li>Changed menu option 'New Object' to 'Window'->'New'.
	<li>Fixed output of Ping, Trace, Whois network utilities.
	
</menu>
<p><font size=+1>Version 1.0b12 - Released May 24, 2001</font>
<menu>
   <li>Added support in triggers for matching multiple words within an incoming
       phrase.
   <li>Added a Windows MDI interface.
   <menu>
   <li>History buffer available.
   <li>Set fonts
   </menu>
   <li>Fixed keyboard mapping for MDI Window interface.
      Was assumed all keyboards were created equal, 
     now the windows keyboard map is used to result in the correct character
     for foriegn keyboards.  Console interface still uses default key mappings.
     TO BE FIXED.
   <li>Updated macros file to check for available interface devices, and 
      create a windows MDI based interface if it exists, otherwise attempt to
      load a console interface.

</menu>
<p><font size=+1>Version 1.0b11 - Released March 20, 2001</font>
<menu>
   <li>Added hotkey support for windows console plugin.  /KEYBIND, /KEYUNBIND...
