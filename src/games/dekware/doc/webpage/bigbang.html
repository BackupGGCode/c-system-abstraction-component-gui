<p>At the moment of creation, the universe is given form; 'The Void' is
created.  'The Void' is then put within itself, so that if an object attempts
to /LEAVE 'The void' it is its own container, and the object essentially stays
within the known universe.
<p>Once 'The Void' is established, the commands in the file 'macros' are executed.&nbsp;
The commands here are responsible for creating any user interfaces, and for
then loading more macros, setups which are needed to create a useful universe.
<p>That's it, pretty simple, eh?&nbsp;  There is still a remote possiblity that
the act of loading a plugin may create a master object, which then must be told
what commands to perform first.&nbsp; If after all plugins are loaded, there is
still no player object, then The Void is awoken, and is instructed to process
the file 'macros'.
