<p>Network address is any network numeric IP or name, followed by an optional
colon, followed by a port number or service name.  
<p>Examples: mit.edu:daytime, ftp.cdrom.com:21, 127.0.0.1
<menu>
	TCP [network address]
   <Menu>
    	This makes an outgoing connection to a TCP port.&nbsp;  Standard format
      for addresses - IP:port.&nbsp;  If port is not specified, the
      default port is telnet. 
   	<p>example: /parse tcp blackmud.com:2000
	   <p>Typically this device is used to make a data connection.&nbsp; Although 
      there may one day exist a server which would be able to issue commands
      to the Nexus command channel, this does not exist today... therefore
      "/command tcp" has little use.
      </menu><br>
   TCPSERVER [network address]
   <menu>
   	This instructs the object to listen at the specified address.&nbsp; If the 
      IP portion is omitted, all available IPs listen at the specified port.&nbsp;
      When an object with a TCPSERVER is connected to, the object is duplicated,
      and a /accept command is issued.&nbsp; Since this command is not an 
      internal command, it is assumed that it is a macro.  If a macro does
      not exist, the connection is made regardless.
		<p>example: /command tcpserver 3245
      <p>This device is typically used to serve command data channels to 
      connecting telnet clients.&nbsp; Although, /parse TCPSERVER 2352, can
      be useful also, using /GetLine %line and /Execute %line, essentially
      resembles a direct command path...
      </menu><br>
   UDP [network address]
   <menu>
   	This opens an outgoing UDP connection to the specified address...
	   <p>example: /parse UDP domain.com:daytime
      <p>No further comment at this time...
 	</menu><br>
   UDPSERVER [network address]
   <menu>
   	This opens a port to listen for incoming UDP datagrams.  When a message
      is received, the IP and PORT prefix data coming from the connection.&nbsp;
      /GetIP and /getport extended commands are used to retrieve this data into Nexus-readable,
      or human readable format.
    </menu>
</menu>
<center><u>Additional Commands</u></center>
<menu>
	SEND [zero or more atoms]
   <menu>
   	Send the data to the current data channel connection.  This is used
      for PARSE type device opens only.&nbsp; If the command entered is not
      undestood, it is not an internal, macro, or plugin extended command,
      the command is forwarded to the data channel for output.
      </menu>
</menu><menu>
	GETADDR [message]
   	<menu>
   	Pull the network IP address from a message.&nbsp; Used when dealing 
      with UDPSERVER devices...
      </menu>
</menu><menu>
	GETIP [message]
   <menu></menu>
</menu><menu>
	GETPORT [message]
   <menu></menu>
</menu><menu>
	HTTP [operation] [variable] [address]
   <menu>
   For now the only operation permitted is GET.&nbsp; This will go to the 
   address and return the page content into the variable.&nbsp; Each of the
   header fields will be returned, followed by the page data.  The page
   data will be binary data, and each of the header fields will be text 
   variables.  

   </menu>
</menu><menu>
   PING [network address]
   <menu>
   	Ping a network address, return timing of responce from the server pinged.
      </menu>
</menu><menu>
   TRACE [network address]
   <menu>
   	Displays a list of the nodes between the issuing computer and the 
      destination address.
      </menu>
</menu><menu>
   PORTSCAN [network address]
   <menu>
   	Attempts to connect to the first 2000 ports at the network address 
      specified.&nbsp; Returns a list of ports which accepted a connection.&nbsp;
      No data is transmitted or received upon connection.
      </menu>
</menu><menu>
   WHOIS [domain name]
   	<menu>
      Looks up information about the specified domain name.
      </menu>
