.You think you just died!
.
.
.Your head pounds and swims.
.Images from your life swirl about you.
.The moment of your own death repeats again and again.
.You are trapped in a seemingly endless dream, unable to wake.
..
..
..
..
..
.The images slowly fade, as your vision darkens.
.The pain throughout your body lets you know you are still alive.
.
.Where are you? What happened to you?
.
.You have but to awaken to find the answers...
