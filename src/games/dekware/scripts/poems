.Once I sat on the side of a hill, I saw time go
.from the sun rise on the east to the setting over the ridges
.to the west, many things crawled and skittered, flittered and 
.slithered, some walked and talked, chirps and buzzes, trills
.and growls, the stars came out, some fell with burning glory
.fireflies in heaven, and all around.
.Once I sat on a road in a town, I saw time go
.from the sun rise on the east to the setting over the roofs
.to the west, many things roamed and snuck, danced and 
.pranced, some walked and talked, shrieks and moans, songs
.and shouts, the stars stayed away, and fires around sent embers
.flying; fireflies on earth, and all above.
