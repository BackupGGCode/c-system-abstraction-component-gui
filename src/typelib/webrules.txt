    if no links, link to here

    if test is below here to there (for all there)
		 then test links to here

          then again for all there....
			 if test is below there to here (-vector) test does not link to there <0 >-1
              else test links to there also

					  <- if there is above here to test
						  unlink there from here

	 else
       move here to there, start over




	if a thing links to there
		for all links from there, perform above test, but do not link to 'here' or 'there'

	after constructing a link, destruction of other invalid links should occur

	destruction of links...

	for check all links from here
		fornext check2 all links from here
			if here->check2 > here->check unlink check2 (link check->check2? double link?)

				forall there from test(original)
					forall next from there
					if( test(original) between there->next )
                  link test(original) to next
