These are some changes I'd like to make, but which would require
datastructure changes, and thus a major shared library version change.


* Improved Parser -- keep the description strings, etc. around.

* Removal of strings -- add a field to the snmp_session structure
  which will contain the error strings for any given operation, rather
  than using the global snmp_errno.
