--  Generic description of how we build software at CMU.  This       --
--  information may help you compile this software at your site, by  --
--  letting you replicate our environment as much as possible.       --


To build this at CMU, we use the program "smake", to allow us to
compile this software on multiple machines from a common src
directory.  SMake is available from:

	ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/tools/smake-037.tar.gz

The included SMakefile configures all of the compiler options on our
machines, based on systype.

Finally, when we build the software for release, the included
"build-COLLECTION.sh" script is used.  This script builds the
collection, cleans up all object files, and keeps a logfile of the
build process in the directory.  (The `sys` command specifies a unique
system type for all platforms.  This is an AFS program -- if you don't
use AFS, you could just use 'uname'.)
